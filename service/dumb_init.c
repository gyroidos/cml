/*
 * The dumb-init signal handler.
 *
 * The main job of this signal handler is to forward signals along to our child
 * process(es). In setsid mode, this means signaling the entire process group
 * rooted at our child. In non-setsid mode, this is just signaling the primary
 * child.
 *
 * In most cases, simply proxying the received signal is sufficient. If we
 * receive a job control signal, however, we should not only forward it, but
 * also sleep dumb-init itself.
 *
 * This allows users to run foreground processes using dumb-init and to
 * control them using normal shell job control features (e.g. Ctrl-Z to
 * generate a SIGTSTP and suspend the process).
 *
 * The libc manual is useful:
 * https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Job-Control-Signals.html
 *
 * When running in setsid mode, however, it is not sufficient to forward
 * SIGTSTP/SIGTTIN/SIGTTOU in most cases. If the process has not added a custom
 * signal handler for these signals, then the kernel will not apply default
 * signal handling behavior (which would be suspending the process) since it is
 * a member of an orphaned process group.
 *
 * Sadly this doesn't appear to be well documented except in the kernel itself:
 * https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v4.2/kernel/signal.c#L2296-L2299
 *
 * Forwarding SIGSTOP instead is effective, though not ideal; unlike SIGTSTP,
 * SIGSTOP cannot be caught, and so it doesn't allow processes a change to
 * clean up before suspending. In non-setsid mode, we proxy the original signal
 * instead of SIGSTOP for this reason.
