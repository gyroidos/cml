/**
 * @file compartment.h
 *
 * The compartment module represents a single compartment and offers an interface for managing it,
 * e.g. starting and stopping, suspending and resuming, etc.
 * Container instances can be created using a low-level constructor with all
 * specific parameters.
 * It furthermore provides the possibility to register observer functions as callbacks
 * which are called when the compartment's state changes. Compartment sub-modules
 * are called at certain key events during the execution of a compartment.
