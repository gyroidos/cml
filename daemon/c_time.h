 * @file c_time.h
 *
 * This module implements the new time namespace available since Linux 5.6.
 * It resest the available clocks for boottime and monotonic by setting the
 * corresponding offsets to the negated current system values.
 * Thus, for instance uptime will show the time since a container was started
 * and not the overall system uptime.
 *
 * Time namespace could not be activated by clone directly but only by a call
 * to unshare. After unshare the calling process is not directly part of the
 * new time namespace, to be allowed to set the new clock offsets. All
 * children will be placed in the new time namespace. To put the later init
 * process of a container also to the new time namespace, a call to setns
 * using /proc/self/time_for_children does the trick.
