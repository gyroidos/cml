  * This module is responsible for mounting images (for a container, at its startup) into the filesystem.
  * It is capable of utilizing a decryption key for mounting encrypted images. When a new container thread
  * gets cloned, the root directory of the images filesystem (and e.g. the proc, sys, dev directories) is/are
  * created and the image is mounted there together with a chroot.
